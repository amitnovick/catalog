Catalog is a free, open source file manager. It helps organize files on local drives by adding
categories to files. Users get the same user interface to manage their files on different platforms.
Catalog is compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac. The application requires neither internet
connection, nor user's registration to run on desktop devices.
