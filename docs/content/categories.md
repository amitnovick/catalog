# Categories

We don't always give meaningful names to our files, and more crucially, we don't always remember the
names we give to files, since we have other things that need our attention. A unique name for every
file is just a limitation that the computer imposes on us, but it doesn't serve our needs.

Instead, we tend to think about a file in terms of what kind of content it is. Indeed, we may have
certain abstractions pop up in our heads, for example: `document`, or `music`, or `recipe` or
`report` and probably a million other things that we could think of.

When you feel that a certain abstraction really fits the way you think, you should go ahead and
materialize that abstraction using a **category**. You then assign this category to files which you
tend to associate with this category's name being the abstraction.

For example, if you use Microsoft Word for writing documents, you can create a category by the name
`Documents` and assign this category to each Word document file.

Tip: you should prefer categories representing more concrete abstractions, such as **which kind of
document**. For instance, `Financial Reports`, `School Papers`, `Cooking Recipes`, etc.
