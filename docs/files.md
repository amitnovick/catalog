### Files

Catalog is meant for files that you care about: documents, audio, video and more.

When there are many files to keep track of, Catalog offers you **categories** which can be assigned
to files;

Related files can go under designated categories like: Documents, Music, Videos etc.

**Categories can also be nested** under other categories: Documents can further contain the
following nested categories: MeetingSummaries, FinancialReports, SchoolPapers etc.

The novelty that Catalog provides lies in how **files can be assigned multiple categories**, and how
the program assists you in preserving the category hierarchy while doing various operations:
assigning a category to a file, moving a nested category to a different parent category, and more.
